## Preliminaries

### Install R

If you don't already have R set up notebook, please download and install it from [here](http://cran.rstudio.com/). 
You can use the code editor of your choice. However, we recommend using [RStudio Desktop](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).


### Installing packages

Packages extend the basic functionality of R and add functions or datasets.
For this course we need a few extra packages. We will provide a script that automatically installs all required packages.

2. Unzip the file - The unzipped folder contains all files and folders of this online repository.


## Structure of the Course

The course is structured into four parts of roughly 1.5-2 hours:

* Model selection for linear and generalized linear models (Ralf B. Sch채fer) **10.00 - 12.00**
* Generalized Additive Models (Andreas Scharm체ller) **13.00 - 14.30**
* Structural equation modelling (Moritz Link) **15.00 - 16.30**
* [Course Evaluation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wYkbajB_q5NPxzqJfS4gAwrRro7BcOd4OE_W5tmiOYo/viewform?usp=send_form) (**16.30 - 16.45**) - see link below.

Each part has its own folder, with slides, data, code and other materials.
Each lecture is structured into: Intro - Demo - Exercise
